“In five years, I would love to be an industry expert that others can go to for ideas, help and strategy. I’ve had amazing mentors and managers 
in my past positions, so I’d like to be able to provide similar guidance, potentially taking on a leadership role. Finally, I’d like to have taken 
the lead on projects I’m passionate about. I’m motivated by connecting my initiatives to the company’s larger goals and I’m excited by the prospect 
of getting more experience in that.



“A few of my future goals for the next few years include leading a design team in some capacity. I’m excited about the prospect of working with product 
and events on developing streamlined processes—this is a natural fit with my project management background. I’d also like to develop my skills in user 
experience to aid in creating more user-focused designs all around.”
