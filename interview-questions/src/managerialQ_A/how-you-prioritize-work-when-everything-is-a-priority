When everything is priority, you could use the following approach

Make a list of all your tasks
Identify task important vs. urgent
identify the task that holds the highest value to your organization and business
Target those topic first whichever one you think will take the most effort to complete
Be adaptable and flexible to the task
May happen that not everything in the list can be achievable, focus on the priorities that you can complete
