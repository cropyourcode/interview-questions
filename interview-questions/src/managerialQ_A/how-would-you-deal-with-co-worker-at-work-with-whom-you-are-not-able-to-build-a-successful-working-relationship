my approach would be

Practice common courtesy like “hello” and “thank you”
Call people with their first name while maintaining the eye contact
Communicate with them on regular basis
Be friendly and encouraging to co-workers
Invite a co-worker for dinner or outing over the weekend
Find out a common interest
Don’t present an unprofessional side in personal or on social sites with co-workers
Keep email on topic and concise as possible
