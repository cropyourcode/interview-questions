The org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory and the org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interfaces acts as the IoC container.
The ApplicationContext interface is built on top of the BeanFactory interface. It adds some extra functionality than BeanFactory such as 
simple integration with Spring's AOP, message resource handling (for I18N), event propagation, application layer specific context
(e.g. WebApplicationContext) for web application. 

So it is better to use ApplicationContext than BeanFactory.
