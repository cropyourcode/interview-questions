Constructor overloading is a technique in Java in which a class can have any number of constructors that differ in parameter list. 
The compiler differentiates these constructors by taking into account the number of parameters in the list and their type.

But if you specify a parametrized constructor like Demo(int a), and want to use the default constructor Demo(), it is mandatory for you to specify it.

In other words, in case your Constructor is overridden, and you want to use the default constructor, its need to be specified.
