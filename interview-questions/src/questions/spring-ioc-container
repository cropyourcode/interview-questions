The IoC container is responsible to instantiate, configure and assemble the objects. The IoC container gets informations from the XML
file and works accordingly. The main tasks performed by IoC container are:

	to instantiate the application class
	to configure the object
	to assemble the dependencies between the objects

There are two types of IoC containers. They are:
BeanFactory
ApplicationContext

The Spring container is at the core of the Spring Framework. The container will create the objects, wire them together, configure them,
and manage their complete life cycle from creation till destruction. The Spring container uses DI to manage the components that make up 
an application.
