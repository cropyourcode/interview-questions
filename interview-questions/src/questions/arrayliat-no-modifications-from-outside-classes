2 Ways.

1)The getter that returns the ArrayList can clone before returning the object. This way, even if the outside entity modifies the object, they'll
end up modifying the clone - not your original object. Note: The clone operation can be costly. I'd suggest the below option.

2)Use Collections.unmodifiableList(..). Check the documentation here.
