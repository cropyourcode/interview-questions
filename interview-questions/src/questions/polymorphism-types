In the last tutorial we discussed Polymorphism in Java. In this guide we will see types of polymorphism. There are two types of 
polymorphism in java:
1) Static Polymorphism also known as compile time polymorphism
2) Dynamic Polymorphism also known as runtime polymorphism

Compile time Polymorphism (or Static polymorphism)
Polymorphism that is resolved during compiler time is known as static polymorphism. Method overloading is an example of compile time 
polymorphism.
Method Overloading: This allows us to have more than one method having the same name, if the parameters of methods are different in number, 
sequence and data types of parameters. We have already discussed Method overloading here: If you didnâ€™t read that guide, refer: Method Overloading in Java


Runtime Polymorphism (or Dynamic polymorphism)
It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch. Dynamic polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, 
thats why it is called runtime polymorphism. I have already discussed method overriding in detail in a separate tutorial, refer it: Method Overriding in Java.
