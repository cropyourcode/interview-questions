Step 1 : First checks whether the key is null or not. If the key is null, it calls putForNullKey() method. table[0] is always reserved for null key. 
Because, hash code of null is 0.

Step 2 : If the key is not null, then it calculates the hash code of the key by calling hash() method.

Step 3 : Calls indexFor() method by passing the hash code calculated in step 2 and length of the table[] array. This method returns index in table[] 
array for the specified key-value pair.

Step 4 : After getting the index, it checks all keys present in the linked list at that index ( or bucket). If the key is already present in the linked list, 
it replaces the old value with new value.

Step 5 : If the key is not present in the linked list, it appends the specified key-value pair at the end of the linked list.
