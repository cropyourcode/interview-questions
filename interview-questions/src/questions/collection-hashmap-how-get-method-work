Step 1 : First checks whether specified key is null or not. If the key is null, it calls getForNullKey() method.

Step 2 : If the key is not null, hash code of the specified key is calculated.

Step 3 : indexFor() method is used to find out the index of the specified key in the table[] array.

Step 4 : After getting index, it will iterate though linked list at that position and checks for the key using equals() method. 
If the key is found, it returns the value associated with it. otherwise returns null.
