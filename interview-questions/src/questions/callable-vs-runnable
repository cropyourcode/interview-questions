1) The Runnable interface is older than Callable, there from JDK 1.0, while Callable is added on Java 5.0.

2) Runnable interface has run() method to define task while Callable interface uses call() method for task definition.

3) run() method does not return any value, it's return type is void while call method returns value. The Callable interface is a generic 
parameterized interface and Type of value is provided when an instance of Callable implementation is created.

4) Another difference on run and call method is that run method can not throw checked exception while call method can throw checked 
exception in Java.
