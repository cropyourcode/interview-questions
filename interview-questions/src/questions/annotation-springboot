Spring Boot Annotations
@EnableAutoConfiguration
This annotation is usually placed on the main application class. The @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation implicitly defines a base “search package”. This annotation tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.

@SpringBootApplication
This annotation is used on the application class while setting up a Spring Boot project. The class that is annotated with the @SpringBootApplication must be kept in the base package. The one thing that the @SpringBootApplication does is a component scan. But it will scan only its sub-packages. As an example, if you put the class annotated with @SpringBootApplication in com.example then @SpringBootApplication will scan all its sub-packages, such as com.example.a, com.example.b, and com.example.a.x.

The @SpringBootApplication is a convenient annotation that adds all the following:

@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
