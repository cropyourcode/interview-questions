Volatile keyword is used to modify the value of a variable by different threads. It is also used to make classes thread safe. 
It means that multiple threads can use a method and instance of the classes at the same time without any problem. 
The volatile keyword can be used either with primitive type or objects.


Using volatile is yet another way (like synchronized, atomic wrapper) of making class thread safe. Thread safe means that a 
method or class instance can be used by multiple threads at the same time without any problem.
Suppose that two threads are working on SharedObj. If two threads run on different processors each thread may have its own local 
copy of sharedVariable. If one thread modifies its value the change might not reflect in the original one in the main memory instantly. 
This depends on the write policy of cache. Now the other thread is not aware of the modified value which leads to data inconsistency.
