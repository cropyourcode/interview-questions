First level Cache vs. Second-level Cache in Hibernate
Now that we have got some basic understanding of the first level and second level cache, here are some differences between them:

1) The primary difference is that first level cache is maintained at the Session level while the second level cache is maintained at 
SessionFactory level.

2)  The data stored in the first level cache is accessible to the only Session who maintains it, while the second level cache is accessible to all.

3) The first level cache is by default enabled while the second level cache is by default disabled.

A couple of things to know about hibernate first level cache:

1) You can use Session.evict() to remove the loaded entity from the first level cache, can use refresh() method to refresh the cache and 
can use clear() method to remove all entities in cache.

2) You cannot disable the first level cache, it always enabled.

3) Hibernate entities or database rows remain in cache only until Session is open, once Session is closed, all associated cached data is lost.
