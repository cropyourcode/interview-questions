The JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) is a collection of useful JSP tags which encapsulates the core functionality common to many JSP applications.

JSTL has support for common, structural tasks such as iteration and conditionals, tags for manipulating XML documents, internationalization tags, 
and SQL tags. It also provides a framework for integrating the existing custom tags with the JSTL tags.

Classification of The JSTL Tags
The JSTL tags can be classified, according to their functions, into the following JSTL tag library groups that can be used when creating a JSP page −

Core Tags

Formatting tags

SQL tags

XML tags

JSTL Functions


Install JSTL Library
To begin working with JSP tages you need to first install the JSTL library. If you are using the Apache Tomcat container, then follow these two steps −

Step 1 − Download the binary distribution from Apache Standard Taglib and unpack the compressed file.

Step 2 − To use the Standard Taglib from its Jakarta Taglibs distribution, simply copy the JAR files in the distribution's 'lib' directory to your 
application's webapps\ROOT\WEB-INF\lib directory.

To use any of the libraries, you must include a <taglib> directive at the top of each JSP that uses the library.
