Spring cache is nothing but a store of key-value pairs, where values are the ones returned from @Cacheable methods, whereas, for 
keys there has to be some strategy to generate them. In our application the cache is implemented on controller class.
The controller will evict the cache memory at interval of 4 hours in a day. This is managed by spring provided cron element of @Scheduler
annotation.
The Cron expression is represented by six fields. Second,Minute,Hour,DayofMonth,Month,DaysofWeek.

Below you can find the example patterns from the spring forum:

* "0 0 * * * *" = the top of every hour of every day.
* "*/10 * * * * *" = every ten seconds.
* "0 0 8-10 * * *" = 8, 9 and 10 o'clock of every day.
* "0 0 8,10 * * *" = 8 and 10 o'clock of every day.
* "0 0/30 8-10 * * *" = 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30 and 10 o'clock every day.
* "0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI" = on the hour nine-to-five weekdays
* "0 0 0 25 12 ?" = every Christmas Day at midnight
Cron expression is represented by six fields:

second, minute, hour, day of month, month, day(s) of week
